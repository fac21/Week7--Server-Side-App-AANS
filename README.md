## Concept

Our app is a playground for the signed up users. They are able to choose one of the multiple games listed in our web-app and play against the machine. For now we only have one game with more coming soon. 

Website name: "Whataa Game"
- logged-In / signed-up / game score /  - users are displayed with flash message of successful/failed/score displays.

DISCLAIMER: we didn't write the game code for this project! it was just lifted from one of our application websites so we could try and connect client side and server side with a real example.
